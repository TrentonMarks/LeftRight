Project 2 -- Trenton Marks
Date: 3/25/18
App Name: Left.Right.


DESCRIPTION:

An CRUD application with MVC file structure that utilized all 7 routes as well as node.js, express, and mongoose.  The app currently allows users to view pictures that users have posted to the homepage as well as creating a username and encrypted password which then allows them to post photos to the homepage as well.  


PURPOSE:

The app is for users that are the perfectionist type that enjoy viewing oddly satisfying photos.  The app will eventually allow users to 'like' or 'favorite' posted images. The idea is that when users leave the site they will be left feeling oddly satisfied, or "Left.Right.".


IMPROVEMENTS:

1) The div containers that surround the posted images need to size correctly/uniformly.

2) Adding more features:
          -- Style Show Page and get photo to appear
          -- Edit/Update passwords and posts
          -- Deleting posts
          -- Adding an 'Account' tab that allows users to view their personal posts
          -- Adding a 'like'/'favorite' button
          -- Add a 'Top 5 Posts' page
